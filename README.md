# movieverse
A Python Package for movie viewing analysis.

Still under development

Will include

- Basic methods to analyse movie viewing behaviour of individual viewers
  or groups of viewers (a 'movieverse').
- Async clients: An async client for the TMDB API and an async scraper for Letterboxd
- Eventually: A recommender system using the FunkSVD algorithm to make
  personalised movie recommendations based on the data of a given movieverse
